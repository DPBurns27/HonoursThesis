I would like to thank everyone who has contributed their time and knowledge to help me in completing my research and this thesis.

For their unending and unquestioning support in this journey, along with their help in editing this thesis, I would like to thank my parents and my girlfriend. Perhaps I will finally learn which its is which.

To my good friends and colleagues Joel Alroe and Nassib Jabbour, I thank you so much for your friendship throughout my entire undergraduate experience. Your enthusiasm for science and life in general is infectious.

I would also like to thank the faculty at QUT. In particular my supervisor Zoran Ristovski for giving me the chance to work on this project. And to Konstantin Momot, your support and guidance meant more to me than I can express.

To Markus Thatcher and Martin Cope at CSIRO, thank you for your patient instruction, and for opening up your models and supercomputers to me. 

Finally, to every Lecturer and Tutor I came across in my ungraduate classes, you made me who I am, and this thesis possible. Thank you.
